# Copilot Instructions – itsworking.no

## Purpose of this repository
- This repository powers the public website for Its Working.
- The site is customer-facing, business-critical, and production-oriented.
- Stability, clarity, and conversion matter more than clever code.

## General Rules
- Do NOT redesign layouts, branding, or UX unless explicitly requested.
- Do NOT change colors, fonts, logos, or spacing without instruction.
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes over refactors.
- Follow existing structure and conventions exactly.

## Content & Messaging
- Treat all text as marketing copy.
- Do NOT rewrite text for “tone improvement” unless asked.
- Do NOT add buzzwords, hype language, or filler.
- Assume all copy is intentional and reviewed.

## Frontend & Performance
- Avoid heavy JavaScript solutions.
- Prefer static HTML/CSS where possible.
- Do NOT introduce new frameworks or libraries.
- Optimize for performance, accessibility, and SEO.

## SEO & Accessibility
- Preserve semantic HTML.
- Do NOT remove heading hierarchy (h1–h6).
- Maintain alt-text, meta tags, and structured content.

## Dependencies
- Do NOT add dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Do NOT upgrade packages unless asked.

## Deployment Awareness
- Assume changes go directly to a live environment.
- Avoid breaking changes.
- If unsure, stop and keep changes minimal.

## Assumptions
- This site must load fast, rank well, and look professional.
- Simplicity beats sophistication.

## Routing & URLs
- Use exact paths as served by the server.
- Preserve `.html` extensions if present.
- Do not change navigation links that cause routing errors.
  
## Forms & Accessibility

- Do not remove labels or accessibility-related attributes.
