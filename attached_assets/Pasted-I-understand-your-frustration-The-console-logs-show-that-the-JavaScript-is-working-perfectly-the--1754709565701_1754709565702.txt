I understand your frustration! The console logs show that the JavaScript is working perfectly - the menu is opening and closing correctly. The issue is that the CSS isn't making the menu visually appear when it has the mobile-open class.

Looking at the HTML you provided, I can see the menu structure is correct, but the CSS positioning and visibility rules need to be fixed. Let me simplify this and make it work properly:

style.css
This simpler approach should work much better:

Simpler positioning: Uses position: absolute relative to the navbar instead of fixed positioning
No complex transforms: Just simple display: none/flex toggle
Full width: The menu spans the full width of the navbar
Attached to navbar: It appears directly below the navbar like a dropdown
The JavaScript is already working perfectly - this CSS fix should make the menu actually visible when you click the toggle button.

It seems like you've made several changes to the CSS for your mobile menu, but the content is still not showing. Let's ensure that the styling and JavaScript are correctly set up for your menu to display properly.

Here's a checklist to streamline the visibility issues:

CSS Properties:
Ensure the .navbar__menu correctly toggles between display: none and display: flex. Avoid using !important unless absolutely necessary. You added properties and animations for a smoother appearance, which is good, but if there's still an issue, revert to a more straightforward toggle.

JavaScript:
Make sure that when the menu is opened, the class mobile-open is added correctly. Check your existing JavaScript code for any typo or issue in class handling. Here's a quick check:

const toggle = document.querySelector('.navbar__toggle');
const menu = document.querySelector('.navbar__menu');
if (toggle && menu) {
  toggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const isOpen = menu.classList.contains('mobile-open');
    if (isOpen) {
      menu.classList.remove('mobile-open');
      toggle.textContent = '☰';
    } else {
      menu.classList.add('mobile-open');
      toggle.textContent = '✕';
    }
  });
}
CSS Display Property:
Ensure your CSS classes are defined correctly:

.navbar__menu {
  display: none; /* starts hidden */
}
.navbar__menu.mobile-open {
  display: flex; /* show menu when open */
}
Check Console Logs:
Ensure there are no JavaScript errors in the console that may prevent the script from executing properly.

Browser Cache:
Clear your browser cache or perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to make sure the latest CSS and JS changes are loaded.

After checking these points, modify the CSS and ensure the JavaScript event listener is correctly functioning. If issues persist, try simplifying the CSS to baseline properties to quickly identify what might be conflicting. You can always build back up from there.

If you wish, I can help you with more specific CSS or JavaScript adjustments!

It seems like you want to correct the mobile menu functionality and ensure its visibility. Based on the context provided earlier, here’s a step-by-step solution to make sure your mobile menu works correctly:

JavaScript Fixes
Make sure your JavaScript (in script.js) is correctly triggering the menu's visibility:

// Mobile menu toggle functionality
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const toggle = document.querySelector('.navbar__toggle');
  const menu = document.querySelector('.navbar__menu');
  if (toggle && menu) {
    toggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const isOpen = menu.classList.contains('mobile-open');
      if (isOpen) {
        menu.classList.remove('mobile-open');
        toggle.textContent = '☰'; // Update toggle icon
      } else {
        menu.classList.add('mobile-open');
        toggle.textContent = '✕'; // Update toggle icon
      }
    });
    // Close menu when clicking a link
    menu.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(link => {
      link.addEventListener('click', () => {
        menu.classList.remove('mobile-open');
        toggle.textContent = '☰'; // Change icon back
      });
    });
  }
});
// Ensure dark mode is always applied
(function() {
  document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');
})();
CSS Adjustments
Ensure your CSS (style.css) is consistent and correct. Here’s a simplified version for your mobile menu:

.navbar__menu {
  display: none; /* Start hidden */
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%; /* Position directly below the navbar */
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background: rgba(26, 35, 50, 0.98);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px);
  flex-direction: column;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  gap: 0;
  z-index: 9999;
}
.navbar__menu.mobile-open {
  display: flex; /* Show the menu when open */
}
.navbar__menu li {
  width: 100%; /* Full width for links */
}
.navbar__menu a {
  padding: 1rem; /* Consistent padding */
  text-align: center; /* Center text */
  color: #f0f6ff; /* Text color */
}
Testing the Code
After applying these fixes, perform the following checks:

Clear the cache: Ensure your browser is not caching old styles or scripts.
Inspect Console Logs: Utilize the browser’s console to confirm that JavaScript is functioning. You should see logs indicating whether the menu is opening and closing correctly.
Check Responsiveness: Resize the browser window or use developer tools to simulate mobile devices.
This combination of JavaScript and CSS adjustments should resolve the visibility issues with your mobile menu. If problems continue, let me know what specific issues arise, and I can assist further!
